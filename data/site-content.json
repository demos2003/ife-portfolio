    "aboutMe": "Hi, I’m Ifeoluwa Olusanya, but most people know me as Hermosa. I’m a content creator and video editor with a passion for telling stories through engaging visuals and creative concepts. Over the years, I’ve worked on different types of projects—from short-form content for social media to longer edits that bring out emotions and keep viewers hooked.\n\nMy journey started with a love for creativity and expressing ideas visually, and that has grown into hands-on experience with content strategy, editing, and creating videos that connect with people. Whether it’s transforming raw footage into polished content, experimenting with trends, or creating original concepts, I enjoy the full process of content creation.\n\nFor me, it’s not just about editing videos—it’s about making ideas come alive and helping brands or individuals share their stories in the most captivating way possible",
